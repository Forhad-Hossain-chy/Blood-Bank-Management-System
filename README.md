# Blood-Bank-Management-System

This is a management system for maintaining a blood bank institution. With this system an institution can easily monitor their business. In this system user can store information of blood donors, buyers and the blood storage. User can sell blood such a way that the sold bloods will be automatically deleted from the blood storage. This system also notifies the authority about the present amount of each blood group.

**Features that are not implemented**

I have planned some more features like,
  - When the stock of any blood group is almost finished the donors with corresponding blood groups will be requested via email to donate blood. If that donor doesn't have any email address, then the authority would be notified to make a call to that donor.
  - Move the expired blood to another table in the database, so that when the authority attempts to sell that bag of blood he/she will be notified the expiration of the blood based on some query on that table.
  
Due to lack of time I couldn't implemented these features. And later on the focus is moved to other academic projects for which this unimplemented features remained unimplemented.
